DOCUMENTATION FOR PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 1 (CS4222)

DONE BY: GOH ENG WEI
MATRIC NO: U090290U

Set up:
Port used - 9001
IP Address used - 127.0.0.1
No. of leds - 3

Instructions:

1. After unzipping the folder, you will see a two scripts, one for compiling and the other for execution of the programs.

2. To compile and upload the firmware, run the script by typing: sh make.sh <device port e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0>
 
3. The PC software has been setup to both send and receive data from the telosb. The script, serial.sh will do the following:

	- Run set up serial forwarder(provided by you) in a new terminal with port 9001 at a baud rate of 115200
	- Run the receiver.py program(provided by you) in a new terminal to listen for incoming packets from port 9001
	- Finally run the sender.py program(provided by you) in a new terminal to send the packet to the telosb

4. The telosb firmware has been written to take in three parameters from the datastructure serial_msg, namely param_one,
 param_two and param_three and each corresponding to BLUE LED, YELLOW LED and finally RED LED. Each of the param will be 
for the sender program to specify the duration to turn each LED on for. The duration will be in milliseconds.

5. To set up and send the commands, run the script by typing:
	sh serial.sh <device port> <BLUE LED duration> <YELLOW LED duration> <RED LED duration>

6. And the three leds should light up and turn off once the specified duration is over.
